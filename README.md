## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

By doing this project, I learnt how to do the Mobile-first workflow which I prefer now...I also learnt how to use a background-image property in CSS.

```css
body {
    height: 100vh;
    font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 30px;
    color: var(--desaturated-blue);
    font-weight: 500;
    background-image: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;  
    background-color: var(--pale-blue);    
}
```

### Continued development
I will still be working on the responsiveness of this project as it is not very smooth for me.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped learn how to place a background image. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This is an amazing website which helps me  understand most of the syntax I didn't know in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this Front End Development.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to The Odin Project for giving me a solid foundation in this field. 
- I will also applaud myself as I have seen massive improvement in my workflow. I started learning less than 2 months ago and I completed this project in 6hours...I think this is just the begining.
